Here is an editor that simplifies KRtDL Mint function in a way so that beginners can start coding some very simple Mint programs.
It is still in beta and lacks a lot of functions and may have bugs so I really need your help to finish this thing, don't be afraid to give feedback to me on Discord @fyyyyik and if you find bugs, please, tell me about it in the "Issues" tab.

For now you can only convert simple functions into Mint code, the functionality to translate Mint code into simpler code will come at a later date. Please be patient.

You can find a list of available functions and how to set it up in the .txt file included in the repositery.
